This folder contains the codes to train the network and cluster the images. 

main.py is the main code with the tuned hyperparameters to reproduce the current results. 

images.zip are the non-overlapping set of images that we use for the clustering task. 

Nets.py contains different network structures. We used these networks and choose the one that results in the minimum error.
